# belly-button-challenge

## Description

This project builds an interactive dashboard that visualizes data on the microbial species that inhabit human belly buttons.

Visit the link via Github Pages to view the dashboard. Use the dropdown menu to look at the data for different test subjects. You can view the top 10 microbial species (operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) that were found for each subject, as well as the demographic information for each subject. You can also hover over the tables to get the name of each species.
